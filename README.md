"#odin-recipes" 
This project was to build a basic website on recipes using new HTML skills I have learned.

Such as the following.

- using HTML boilerplate
- headings <h1>
- directories
- links <a href="">
- images <img src="">
- paragraphs <p>
- ordered lists <ol>
- unordered lists <ul>
- lists <li>
