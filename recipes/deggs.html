            <ol>
                <li>Place eggs into a saucepan in a single layer and cover with water by 1 inch. Cover the saucepan and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and let eggs stand in hot water for 15 minutes. Drain and cool under cold running water in the sink.</li>
                <li>Peel cool eggs and cut in half lengthwise. Place yolks into a mixing bowl and set whites aside. Mash yolks with a fork until smooth; stir in mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, hot sauce, salt, and pepper. Spoon yolk mixture into a heavy plastic bag; snip a corner off the bag to create a 1/2-inch opening. Pipe yolk mixture into egg white halves. Chill for at least 30 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with parsley and paprika to garnish.</li>
